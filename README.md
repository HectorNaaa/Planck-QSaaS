# Planck-QSaaS — Short Overview

Planck-QSaaS is Planck’s hybrid orchestration platform to run and integrate quantum workflows into data pipelines. It prioritizes **local-first** execution (micro-LLM on client when possible) with safe **server fallback** to managed backends. The platform provides reproducible pipelines, queueing and quota controls, privacy-minded logging with user-deletions (GDPR-ready), observable metrics and alerting, and simple APIs for pilots and production rollout.

**For teams:** use Planck-QSaaS to accelerate simulations, optimizations and ML workloads without rearchitecting your stack — validate with a pilot (upload a sample dataset) and get a short report with time, cost and integration recommendations.

**Core ideas:** local-first execution, safe fallback, modular RAG + inference, privacy-first logging, observable ops, and smooth path from PoC to production.

**Get started (dev):** clone the repo, copy the example env, start the provided dev compose, run tests, and use the sample demo script to submit a CSV and retrieve a benchmark report.
